First Floor - Main Room
You find yourself at the entrance of the mansion you and your friends entered. The room seems old. Dust fills your lungs.
*
You notice a flight of carpeted stairs to your left, it has some rust coloured stain. You see a fireplace in front of some antique carpet with a strange design and windows that seem to be boarded shut.
**
STAIRS: The door at the top and side of the stairs are locked.
FIREPLACE: The are burnt logs in the fireplace. The ash seems odd. You need a key to open the protective cover. > You push away the logs and wipe away the ash. There seems to be an engraving on the stone. "XXXX".
CARPET: The pattern on the carpet reminds you of your grandparents house. There is a small bump underneath. > You pull back the carpet to reveal a safe! You need a combination to open it.
WINDOW: The window is boarded shut. Be careful not to get scratched by those rusty nails. > OUCH! You got cut by the nail attempting to pull off the wooden boards.
